# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk. As a part of this analysis, multiple models will be tested in order to determine which Machine Learning (ML) model is able to best predict credit risk. The models tested include Logistic Regression model with a variety of sampling techniques including (1) an oversampling model, (2) a Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), (3) a Cluster Centroid undersampling technique, (4) a combination SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) technique. In addition, we tested a Balanced Random Forest model and
